  <p>Most of what I've learned in the data space so far has been through self-learning. But it wouldn't have been possible without the help of many skilled and generous professionals out there. <p>Here are some of the invaluable resources I've come across throughout my journey (most of them are freely available).</p>
  <p>I hope you find them useful and remember: <b>never stop learning</b>!</p>

    <p>Ruth Pozuelo is a Microsoft Data Platform MVP. Her YouTube channel, <b>Curbal</b>, has tone of information on Power BI, including her view on new features, tips on DAX, M, and so on.</p>

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFp1vaKzpfvoGai0vE5VJ0w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guy in a Cube</a>
    <p>Similarly to Curbal, this channel is likely to have almost everything you need to know about Power BI.</p>

    <a href="https://www.sqlbi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sqlbi</a>
    <p>sqlbi is managed by the Power BI experts Marco Russo and Alberto Ferrari. The content they produce is great, especially when it comes to DAX and data modeling.</p>

      <p>I use Microsoft Learn for both preparing for certifications and brushing up on certain solutions. </p>
      <p>I didn't used to be a big fan of Microsoft's documentation, but I have to admit that Microsoft has been doing a great job at improving its training materials and delivery methods.</p>
      <p>Microsoft Learn is becoming more engaging and relevant each day. Some of its learning paths even include labs, which I find extremely helpful.</p>

  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corey Schafer</a>
  <p>This is one of those channels I wish I had found earlier. 
  <p>Learning a programming language is often an overwhelming experience, at least it has been the case for me. Finding professionals like Corey Schafer, whith such clear explanations has definetely helped make my learning journey a bit less bumpy and I wish more people can benefit from his work.</p>

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9uPNppGsGo&list=PLHz_AreHm4dlKP6QQCekuIPky1CiwmdI6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Curso em Video</a>
  <p>For the <b>Portuguese </b>speakers out there willing to get started with Python, <b>Curso em Video</b> might be the way to go. It has one of the best (if not the best) free Python courses I've found so far.</p>
  <p>They also have courses on other programming languages and technologies, which I highly recommend.</p>
