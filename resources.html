    <p>Ruth Pozuelo is a Microsoft Data Platform MVP. Her YouTube channel "Curbal" has tone of information on Power BI, including her view on new features, tips on DAX, M, and so on.</p>

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFp1vaKzpfvoGai0vE5VJ0w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guy in a Cube</a>
    <p>Similarly to Curbal, this channel is likely to have almost everything you need to know about Power BI.</p>

    <a href="https://www.sqlbi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sqlbi</a>
    <p>sqlbi is managed by the Power BI experts Marco Russo and Alberto Ferrari. The content they produce is great, especially when it comes to DAX and data modeling.</p>

      <p>I use Microsoft Learn for both preparing for certifications and brushing up on certain technologies. </p>
      <p>Although I am not a big fan of Microsoft documentation in general, I have to admit that Microsoft has indeed been doing a great job improving its training material and delivery methods.</p>
      <p>Microsoft Learn has helped immensily lately. Some of its learning paths even include labs, which is super helpful.</p>

  <p>For the <b>Portuguese </b>speakers out there willing to get started with Python, "Curso em Video" might be the way to go. It has one of the best (if not the best) free Python courses I have found so far.</p>
  <p>They also have courses on other programming languages and technologies.</p>
