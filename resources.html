      <p>Most of what I've learned in the data space so far has been through self-learning. But it wouldn't have been possible without the help of many skilled and generous professionals out there. Here are some great resources I've come across throughout my journey (most of them are freely available). I hope you find them useful!</p>

      <h4 class="w3-text-teal">General Data Analytics Content</h4>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7cs8q-gJRlGwj4A8OmCmXg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex The Analyst</a>
      <p>In his channel, Alex Freberg shares precious tips that both new and more experienced Data Analysts can benefit from. It includes SQL tutorials, suggestions and clear guidance on how to build a portfolio, course recommendations, and much more.</p>
      
      <br></br>

      <h4 class="w3-text-teal">SQL</h4>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnz-ZXXER4jOvuED5trXfEA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">techTFQ</a>
      <p>This is a great Data Analytics YouTube channel, with especially good tutorials on <b>SQL</b> and Python.</p>
      <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql?ref=resume_learning#sql-basics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Khan Academy</a>
      <p>There are plenty of high quality courses freely available on this platform and <b>SQL basics</b> is one of them.</p>

      <br></br>

      <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Python</h4>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corey Schafer</a>
      <p>This is one of those channels I wish I had found earlier. Learning a programming language is often an overwhelming experience, at least it has been the case for me. Finding professionals like Corey Schafer, whith such clear explanations has definetely helped make my learning journey a bit less bumpy and I wish more people can benefit from his work.</p>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9uPNppGsGo&list=PLHz_AreHm4dlKP6QQCekuIPky1CiwmdI6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Curso em Video</a>
      <p>For the <b>Portuguese </b>speakers out there willing to get started with Python, Curso em Video might be the way to go. It has one of the best (if not the best) free Python courses I've found so far. </p>

      <br></br>

      <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Power BI</h4>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ7UhloHSA4wAqPzyi6TOkw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Curbal</a>
      <p>Ruth Pozuelo is a Microsoft Data Platform MVP. Her YouTube channel, <b>Curbal</b>, has tone of information on Power BI, including her view on new features, tips on DAX, M, and so on.</p>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFp1vaKzpfvoGai0vE5VJ0w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guy in a Cube</a>
      <p>Similarly to Curbal, this channel is likely to have almost everything you need to know about Power BI.</p>
      <a href="https://www.sqlbi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sqlbi</a>
      <p>sqlbi is managed by the Power BI experts Marco Russo and Alberto Ferrari. The content they produce is great, especially when it comes to DAX and data modeling.</p>

      <br></br>

      <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Other Microsoft Technologies</h4>
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Learn</a>
      <p>I've used Microsoft Learn for both preparing for certifications and brushing up on several solutions. I didn't used to be a big fan of Microsoft's documentation, but I have to admit that Microsoft has been doing a great job at improving its training materials and delivery methods.</p>

      <br></br>

      <h4 class="w3-text-teal">Platforms to Practice Coding</h4>
      <p>It's highly recommended that you put your skills into practice as much as possible, which you can do by creating your own portfolio. You can also practice coding for free on websites such as:
      <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3Schools</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hacker Rank</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LeetCode</a></p>
